### **v0.1.0**

This Version improves the production of documentation.

With the integration of `.terraform-docs`, documentation for Terraform files can be almost fully automated.
Follow the steps in the [Contribute.md](Contribute.md) file to populate the sub-module and generate content.

To improve the documentation output, follow the [guidance](../.terraform-docs/ReadMe.md) provided by this sub-module.

> Files will be crated to populate content in defined templates.<br>*These files must be present for templates to validate successfully.*
